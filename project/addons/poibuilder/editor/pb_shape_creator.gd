## PBShapeCreator — ProBuilder-style drag-to-create state machine.
##
## Pure logic + geometry (no editor classes, headless-testable). The plugin
## drives it from viewport input:
##
##   ARMED  — a shape was picked from the New Shape menu; waiting for an
##            LMB press on a surface (PBMesh face or the editor grid plane).
##   BASE   — LMB held: the base rect grows coplanar with the surface that
##            was pressed (the plane is captured at press and never changes).
##   HEIGHT — LMB released: mouse motion adjusts the 3rd dimension along the
##            surface normal (the shape preview grows from its base); the
##            next LMB click confirms.
##   OFFSET — the sprite and plane flows: the third dimension is a STAND-OFF
##            from the surface rather than a size. The sprite reaches it by a
##            single click that anchors it ON the surface; the plane drags a
##            base rect out parallel to the surface first and then lifts clear
##            of it. Either way mouse motion displaces the shape along the
##            surface normal (clamped >= 0), and the next click confirms.
##   PARAMS — the overlay parameter modal is open (live preview, Apply /
##            Cancel). Cancel restores session_values (the state at modal
##            open); neither destroys the shape — only ESC before the
##            confirming click aborts without creating anything.
##
## The plugin owns the preview PBMesh node; the creator supplies the data
## (PBShapeParams.build) and the placement transform that anchors the data's
## base face onto the drag plane at the rect center.

## Trim placement — the drawn rect is the strip's FACE (its length by its

## edge so a drag begun at the wall leaves the trim's back flush with it.
##   - Horizontal surface (floor): the strip STANDS UP on the line through the
##     drag start along its RUN — the longer side of the drawn rect — with the
##     depth running toward the drift along the other side ("on a floor ...
##     start at the wall"). Which side is longer must not depend on the u
##     lock (the first centimetres of motion): mapping u→length literally let
##     an accidental perpendicular wobble stand the whole drag length TALL.
##   - Any other surface (a wall): the strip lies FLAT ON the surface — face
##     in the surface plane, bottom on the drag's lower edge, depth
##     protruding along the surface normal (out of the wall). The height axis
##     is world-up in the surface plane and the run is the more horizontal
##     side, so mouldings sit upright whatever the lock did.
## The trim's local space: +Z = length (centered span), +X = depth from the
## back (x=0) out, +Y = height from the bottom (y=0) up — so the placement
## basis directly maps those axes onto the drag geometry, and later Depth /
