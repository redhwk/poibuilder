title: Walkthrough — export to PSP / retro
lead: Take a finished map to the retro target: export the .pbm, verify it, and implement the format in your own retro engine from the format spec and the reference renderer.
---

The retro pipeline is the reason PoiBuilder exists: build a map with modern editor comfort, then export a map a 2004 handheld can chew. This walkthrough picks up where the [modern walkthrough](walkthrough-modern.html) ended — the same demo map, now headed for the PSP. (PSP performance is hand-confirmed smooth for the reference maps; the rough edges that remain on the device are listed in [Known issues](known-issues.html).)

## About the scripts on this page

The PSP pipeline is the one place this documentation leans on scripts that
live in the PoiBuilder repository rather than on editor buttons:
`run_viewer.sh` (the Godot viewer of a bake), `run_psp.sh` (build + run on
the device over PSPLink), and the hardware measurement loop around them.
They are reference tooling, written for OUR bench setup — a Linux
workstation, a real PSP over USB, PSPLink, one specific Godot build. Treat
them as something to READ and adapt, not as turnkey installers: paths,
device names and the run loop may well need adjusting to your machine.
The contract is still the file format (section 3) — the scripts only make
it convenient to verify and to see the map running.

## 1. Export the .pbm

Toolbar [[btn:export]] → **PBM — PoiBuilder Retro Map (PSP)** → Export. One click writes `res://exports/exported_map.pbm` (and you can write a retro-baked `.glb` of the same bake alongside it for previewing in Godot).

What the export does to your map — all automatic:

- Subdivides faces to the texture tiling grid (optional).
- Bakes direct light, shadows and AO into **vertex colours**.
- Bakes splat paint and decals into unique **tile** textures; unpainted tiles reuse the base.
- Sanitizes every texture: power-of-two, clamped to the max size you chose (default 512), alpha rules per material.
- Writes collision hulls, lights, billboards, particle emitters, walkable meshes, and the environment preset (Dawn/Day/Dusk/Night — the demo map is Dusk).

Authoring constraints for the target are documented in the [Retro Authoring Guide](https://github.com/Francesco149/poibuilder/blob/master/retro_engine/RETRO-AUTHORING.md) — architecture scale, particle budgets, the texture-cache cliff, and what the bake does per material.

## 2. Verify before the device

- `./run_viewer.sh` — the same bake in a Godot viewer (baked / vertex colour / textures / wireframe / colliders + play mode). If it looks wrong here, it is not the PSP's fault.
- PPSSPP — "does it look right" ONLY. The emulator rasterizes on your host GPU with a huge texture cache; its frame rate tells you nothing about the device ([why](faq.html)).

## 3. The format is the contract

The `.pbm` binary layout is fully specified in [The PBM format specification](pbm-format.html) — geometry, tiles, lights, billboards, emitters, colliders, the environment lump, and the consumer-side performance rules the format was designed around.

**To run your map in your own retro engine, implement the format against that spec.** The repository's PSP homebrew engine is the **reference implementation**:

- [`retro_engine/psp/pbm_loader.c`](https://github.com/Francesco149/poibuilder/blob/master/retro_engine/psp/pbm_loader.c) reads every lump of a `.pbm` — the sanest starting point.
- [`retro_engine/`](https://github.com/Francesco149/poibuilder/tree/master/retro_engine) is the reference renderer and viewer around it.

It is a proof of concept and a performance sanity check, not an engine you ship: no gameplay, no scripting. Read the loader, take the format, and wire it into YOUR engine — that is the intended use.

## 4. On the real device

The reference build runs on real hardware over USB:

- `./run_psp.sh` builds the PSP eboot (when missing) and runs the map on the device via PSPLink.
- [`HARDWARE-TESTING.md`](https://github.com/Francesco149/poibuilder/blob/master/retro_engine/psp/HARDWARE-TESTING.md) documents the measurement loop; [`OPTIMIZATION.md`](https://github.com/Francesco149/poibuilder/blob/master/retro_engine/psp/OPTIMIZATION.md) carries the measured cost of every engine decision.

## 5. If something looks wrong on the PSP

Known rough edges are collected in [Known issues](known-issues.html) — the ones specific to the device: billboards render unlit regardless of their lit flag, a transparent scrolling plane can cast an unexpected shadow, and a poibuilderized mesh can export with mangled UVs while looking fine in the editor. Check there before filing a bug.
