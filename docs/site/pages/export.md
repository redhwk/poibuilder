title: Export & retro
lead: PBM is the headline product — a quick export bakes a tile-baked .pbm with vertex light for the PSP. GLB (retro-baked or modern) is one dialog away. Retro textures are sanitized on the way out.
---

Toolbar [[btn:export]] opens the dialog: **Format** defaults to PBM (`res://exports/exported_map.pbm`), with two GLB flavors below it — the Modern Bake first, the Retro Baked Map second. Everything else on the page applies per format.

For the whole journey on one map, see the [walkthroughs](walkthrough-modern.html):
build → export → play, once per pipeline.

> [gotcha] The PoiBuilder scene as-is is the *authoring* format — the live splat shader and decal layers carry a significant performance cost (~4× the retro bake's frame time on the [benchmark baseline](performance.html)). It is highly recommended to **export and play the baked map** (GLB for the modern pipeline, PBM for retro); keep the editable scene for building, testing and iterating.

## Modern GLB (baked)

The format to play and ship on the modern pipeline — selecting it in the dialog defaults to the optimized bake: **paint baked into textures, no vertex lighting**. Authored geometry is kept; collision meshes are named `Collider_*`; lights are exported as lights, so your realtime lights or a LightmapGI bake stay in charge. Paint has its own switch, **Modern paint**:

Two authored looks glTF cannot carry come along as data on the nodes, and a Godot consumer restores them with a few lines (the frame benchmark does exactly this): **shadow flags** — a shadow-casting light tags its glTF node with `poi_shadow` extras, since KHR_lights_punctual has no shadow field — and the **environment preset** name, stamped on the scene root as `poi_env_preset`.

The display environment a consumer applies depends on the flavor, and the difference matters:

- **Retro bake** — the map is *fully baked*: every lumen already lives in the vertex colors and tile textures. The consumer adds NO lighting of any kind; it shows the preset's sky and linear fog and nothing else — `PBEnvironment.apply_retro_display(root, preset)`, which mirrors the PSP renderer exactly. Applying the live preset on top double-lights the map (measured +54% mean luminance at day vs the device) and a filmic tonemap re-decides colors the bake already decided.
- **Modern bake** — the map keeps live materials and realtime lights (with shadows restored from `poi_shadow`), so the full authored environment comes back via `PBEnvironment.apply_preset(root, preset)`: the same sky, ambient and filmic tonemap the editor showed.

A bare imported GLB with neither step renders with engine defaults and reads wrong.

- **Bake into textures** (default) — every painted face is composited into its own texture at the same texel density the editor used (256 texels/m), and its UV1 is rewritten into that texture. Self-contained: Godot, Blender, any glTF consumer shows your paint.
- **Include splat data** — the geometry keeps its mask coordinates (`TEXCOORD_2`), each painted face's material carries a `poi_splat` record in its glTF `extras`, and the masks, layer textures and decal channel ship as PNGs next to the `.glb` under `<map>.splat/`. Use this when the consumer should re-blend at runtime. The recipe (with a reference shader) is in `docs/modern_glb_splat.md`; `PBSplatImport.rebuild_from_extras()` restores live, editable paint after a round trip into Godot.

## Retro baked map

The path the PSP eats — and what PBM is: the same bake written straight to the binary map instead of a GLB waypoint.

What the export does:

- Subdivides faces to the texture tiling grid (optional).
- Bakes direct light, shadows, AO into **vertex colours**.
- Bakes splat paint and the decal layer into unique **tile** textures; unpainted tiles reuse the base.
- Writes collision hulls.
- Writes lights, billboards, particle emitters, walkable meshes, environment preset.

Output: `.glb` as transport, and/or `.pbm` (the binary map). Both land in `project/exports/` (gitignored). The retro GLB still transports the light nodes (handy for dynamic objects), but the baked surfaces are vertex-lit — the reference viewer *hides* the imported lights to avoid double-lighting, and so should a viewer meant to reproduce the bake.

## Scrolling textures

A scrolling texture is a property of the **material**: the Material dock writes a speed (in texture repeats per second, per UV axis, signed — negative V falls down a wall) onto the material, and the editor viewport animates it live. The exports carry the *speed*, not the animation — whichever consumer wants motion applies the one-line recipe `uv(t) = uv(0) + t · speed`:

- **PBM** — each mesh's header stores `uv_scroll_u` / `uv_scroll_v` ([format §5.1](pbm-format.html#5-1-standard-specification-animated-uv-scrolling)), and the bake exempts scrolling faces from the tile atlas so the face keeps a texture that can slide. For a proven implementation, read the reference PSP engine — `retro_engine/psp/psp_render.c` applies the offset per moving mesh on the device — or the Godot viewer, which replays it the same way.
- **GLB (either flavor)** — the speed rides the material's glTF `extras` as `"poi_uv_scroll": [u, v]` (repeats per second), in both the retro and modern bakes. A consumer that wants the falls to fall reads that record and offsets the material's UVs over time; without those few lines the GLB shows the water at rest — which is exactly what a static glTF viewer will do.

> [gotcha] Do not splat-paint a scrolling face. Paint bakes to a static tile; keep painted and scrolling surfaces on separate faces.

## Texture sanitization

Retro consumers — the PSP especially — want **power-of-two** dimensions at or below **max texture size** (default 512). The export enforces that on every albedo, including:

- `PBMesh` tiles
- Ordinary MeshInstance3D props you did **not** Poibuilderize
- Particle atlases

A 300×180 import becomes a POT image ≤ 512. A 2048 atlas is downsized. Soft-alpha (blend) travels as RGBA8888; everything else prefers RGBA5551.

The dialog's "max texture size" dropdown is that clamp. Leave it at 512 unless you have measured a reason not to.

## Environment

The Env menu (Dawn / Day / Dusk / Night) relights the scene. Export stores the preset name. The PSP app can override it at runtime.

## The retro demo engine is a proof of concept

The PSP engine in this repository (`retro_engine/psp/`) exists to answer two
questions: does the `.pbm` format hold up, and how fast is a real retro
target running it? That is all it tries to be — **a proof of concept and a
performance sanity check**, not a game engine you ship with. It has no
gameplay, no scripting, no toolchain polish, and it never will.

The contract is the **file format**, not the demo:

- The `.pbm` binary layout is fully specified in
  [The PBM format specification](pbm-format.html) —
  write your own loader against it in your engine of choice.
- The demo engine in the repo is a **reference implementation**: read its
  loader (`retro_engine/psp/pbm_loader.c`) and renderer to see how the format
  is meant to be consumed, then take what you need.
- To eyeball the bake in Godot, reference the repository's viewer script
  (`run_viewer.sh`) or roll your own: it renders the same bake (baked /
  vertex colour / textures / wireframe / colliders + play mode).

## Authoring for the retro target

Architecture constraints, performance measurements, and the `.pbm` byte layout are documented on GitHub:

- [Retro Authoring Guide](https://github.com/Francesco149/poibuilder/blob/master/retro_engine/RETRO-AUTHORING.md) — Godot authoring recipes and export baking rules.
- [PSP Optimization Guide](https://github.com/Francesco149/poibuilder/blob/master/retro_engine/psp/OPTIMIZATION.md) — hardware architecture, fill rates, and the 19x texture cache cliff.
- [Retro Demo Engine](https://github.com/Francesco149/poibuilder/tree/master/retro_engine) — the reference C renderer and viewer described above.

A scrolling material must not be atlas-packed; export already exempts it.

> [gotcha] PPSSPP is for "does it look right". Because host GPUs have massive caches, the emulator hides the PSP's ~8 KB texture cache cliff (a 19x drop from 480 Mfrag/s to 25 Mfrag/s on misses). Do not tune performance from the emulator.
