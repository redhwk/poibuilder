## The dock

Toolbar [[btn:materials::Material]] focuses the Material & UV dock. It is six modes on one segmented row:

| Mode | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Material & UV** | The palette below — per-face assignment, drag-and-drop, UV speed. |
| **Texture Paint** | The splat brush — see [Paint & stamps](paint.html). |
| **Stamp** | Decal stamps in one click. |
| **Sprite** | Always-armed billboard placement. |
| **Shapes** | Always-armed primitive placement: pick a shape, drag it on any surface. |
| **Particles** | Click-to-place particle emitters (PSP-budget aware). |

The palette itself:

- Swatch grid of project materials.
- Click a face (face or texture mode), click a swatch — that face takes the material.
- Drag a texture from the FileSystem dock onto a face.
- **+ Add** pulls a material or texture from anywhere in the project; the
  scan deduplicates by content so one texture does not appear twice.

Texture mode ([[kbd:6]]) transforms the selected faces' UVs in 3D with the same gizmo — see [Texture mode](select.html#texture-mode-move-uvs-in-the-3d-view). For island work, use the [2D UV editor](uv.html).

## Auto-UV

New shapes unwrap with a 1×1 m repeat. Rules the plugin keeps:

- Resize does not stretch — UVs stay locked to object space, so a 2 m wall still shows 2 tiles.
- Coplanar faces share a seam anchor, so a merged wall does not crawl.
- Diagonal faces tile along their plane, not a projected smash.

If a ramp still looks stretched, that is a projection job: [UV editor](uv.html).

## Smoothing

[[btn:smooth_auto::Auto Smooth]] (row 3) sets smoothing groups from a 45° dihedral. Hard edges stay hard; shallow joins pick up shared normals. Lighting, not geometry.

## Particle emitters

The dock's **Particles** tab places stateless particle emitters: pick a particle texture (flame, smoke, glow presets arm themselves), click a surface, drag to lift and tune, click to commit — the click-by-click lives in the [modern walkthrough](walkthrough-modern.html#7-particle-emitters). Fine-tune any placed emitter by selecting it and opening **⚙ Edit Emitter Properties** on the overlay (count, size, speed, spread, additive blending, flipbook grid).

What "stateless" means, and why it is the headline: an emitter is authored as an ordinary `GPUParticles3D` for the editor, but its playback is a **closed form** — particle *i* at time *t* is a pure function of `(t, i, seed)`. There is no simulation to tick and no per-particle state to keep:

- deterministic — the same emitter always produces the same fire, so what you preview is what every consumer shows;
- cheap — a runtime re-derives each particle with a few flops, one draw call per emitter, no per-frame CPU cost that grows with age;
- additive emitters need no depth sorting; blended ones draw back-to-front;
- exportable as **data** — the retro `.pbm` carries a standard `emitters` lump and a modern `.glb` tags each emitter node with a `poi_emitter` record in its glTF extras (count, colors, spread — the whole authoring), so your engine rebuilds the identical effect instead of eyeballing it.

Placement knobs are budget-aware for the retro target: 64 particles per emitter and roughly 256 per map. See [Export & retro](export.html) for what ships and the [format spec](pbm-format.html) for the lump layout.

## Scroll

A material can carry a UV scroll speed (repeats per second, per axis, signed). It plays in the editor viewport and **survives export as data**: per-mesh `uv_scroll` in the retro formats, `poi_uv_scroll` in a modern GLB material's glTF extras. The animation itself is the consumer's one-liner (`uv(t) = uv(0) + t · speed`) — the recipes are on [Export & retro](export.html#scrolling-textures). Waterfalls are a scrolling plane, not a shader graph.

> [gotcha] Textures that "slide" when you extrude were a bug class. Extrude is supposed to continue tiling across the new seam. If it does not, file it — do not compensate by hand-scaling UVs on every extrude.
